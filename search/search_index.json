They are typically staffed by people who identify, acquire, classify and organize information of interest from different sources for the benefit of those seeking to gain knowledge.</p> <p>The word library is derived from the Latin words liber (a book or document) contained in a libraria (a collection of books), and librarium (a container of books).</p> <p>The gathering of knowledge started with the Sumerians who documented on clay tablets using a complex system of writing called cuneiform dating back to 2600 BC, a more basic form existed dating back some 3400 to 3500 BC.</p> <p>The Great Library of Alexandria was one of the largest and most significant libraries of the ancient world. How many scrolls and text it housed is unknown, but it was estimated to be anywhere from 40,000 to 400,000 at it's peak.</p> <p>Because of its vast collection, Alexandria was known to be the capital of knowledge and learning with many important and influential scholars actually working in the library.</p> <p>The decline of the library began with the purging of intellectuals from Alexandria in 145 BC under the reign of Ptolemy VIII Physcon, and the burning by Julius Caesar in 48 BC with a slow decline over time until its eventual end.</p> <p>This opening post is not here to serve as a history lesson but to introduce us to the idea of how, through the housing of information that is made available to others, we can greatly improve, as well as ensure the survivability and accessibility of knowledge and learning, be it for public consumption or to ensure business continuity, and to highlight how easy it is to loose important knowledge that is critical to future generations when the people that had the knowledge are not around anymore.</p> DOCUMENTATION is COMMUNICATION <p>Having good documentation is essential to having a stong educated society, good business and employee experiences as well as to ensure that you are passing knowledge on to the next generation of people that will replace you in the future. Writing them however, can seem overwhelming and difficult to implement and maintain as the information needed to support our documentation, as well as the audience relying on them keep changing and growing more diverse.</p> <p>Documentation creates the first impression our visitors, students, customers and peers have about us, our products and the services we offer; and nobody likes poorly written documentation. Imagine trying to build a Lego set for your child, or, trying to install new brakes on your car but the instructions are either not clear enough or have pieces missing all together.</p> <p>Well written documentation that caters to everyone is better for inclusivity as it allows us to better support our peers regardless of their age or technical capabilities. Keep in mind that your writings will reach people of all cultures, geography locations, education levels, ages and languages, they will also need to cater for many different disciplines.</p> <p>These factor all add to the complexity of writing great documentation.</p>","tags":["general"]},{"location":"blog/2024/07/01/The%20gathering%20and%20dissemination%20of%20knowledge%20is%20important%20to%20growing%20and%20maintaining%20a%20well%20educated%20society.%20In%20Business%2C%20it%20is%20essential%20to%20have%20good%20Documentarian./#solving-problems","title":"Solving Problems","text":"<p>Good documentation solves problems, you should start your documentation projects by asking why do you need documentation and how can you solve for those needs.
