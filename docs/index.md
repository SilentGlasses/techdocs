These guides define best practices that should be used to create and/or improve your documentation, they serve as guides to use as you venture on your documentation journey and are divided into sections covering writing, multimedia, charting and styling.

## Why Write Documentation

Having documentation is essential to having good business and employee expediencies, they can however, seem overwhelming and difficult to implement and maintain as the information and the audience is diverse and is ever changing.

Documentaiton creates the first impression someone has about us and the services we provide and nobody like poor documentation. Documentation that caters to everyone, is better for exclusivity as it allows us to better support both our technical and our non-technical peers and leads to a better overall experience for everyone.

## Best Practices

Good documentation is accomplished by ensuring we are mindful of the foundation stones, they are:

- **Consistency**: Creating documentation in a similar style sets creator and reader expectations.
- **Language and Tone**: Using proper language and tone shows we care about our readers.
- **Multimedia**: It's not about how many words you can write, but, how best to educate your readers, sometimes it's better to show.
- **Charting**: Help your readers navigate your products visually as well.
- **Inclusivity**: Culmination of all the above, ensure we are being inclusive of our readers needs.

## Solving Problems

Good documentation solves many problems, the following is only a short list of important ones:

- **Business Continuity**: When catastrophe hits, and it will, we want to be able to resolve issues quickly and efficiently to ensure you experiences minor impact.
- **Onboarding**: Make your onboarding process autonomous, allow seasoned employees to focus on important work while new hires onboard at their own pace.
- **Knowledge Retention**: Keep important knowledge in-house when employees leave.

Great documentation serves multiple conflicting masters as it explains the same thing in multiple ways.

- **Tutorials**: Quick introductions to your project, service or platform. These should be quick, allowing readers to experience wins within 30 minutes.
- **Topic Guides**: Detailed explanation of _why_ to foster understanding, these should work readers through accomplishing something in a step by step process.
- **Reference**: Comprehensive guides on all critical pieces of your platforms.
- **Troubleshooting / FAQs**: Answers to questions for when people get stuck and you will need to guide them. Mainly for Issues you expect to arise or issues that have been experienced already.
- **SOPs**: Provide detailed steps to get to a desired outcome. These are similar to References but provide more instructional guides, think about a software release process.
